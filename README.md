---

## 🧠 Approach
- Follow NeetCode problems **in order**
- Solve **2–3 problems daily**
- Revisit previously solved problems to reinforce patterns
- Write clean, readable, and optimized solutions
- Track progress publicly on GitHub

---

## 🧩 Patterns Covered
- Linked List
- Sliding Window
- Stack  
- Trees
_ Binary search
*(More patterns will be added gradually)*

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Language: **Python**
- Platform: **LeetCode**
