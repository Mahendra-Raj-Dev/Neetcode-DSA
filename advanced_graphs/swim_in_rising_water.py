# Problem: Swim in Rising Water
# Pattern: graph traversal (Dijkstra / min-heap on grid)
# Approach:
# - Use a min-heap to always process the cell with minimum current time
# - Move in 4 directions and track the maximum elevation seen so far
# - The first time reaching the bottom-right cell gives the minimum required time
# Time complexity: O(N^2 log N), where N is grid size
# Space complexity: O(N^2)

class Solution:
    def swimInWater(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        N = len(grid)
        visit = set()
        minHeap = [[grid[0][0], 0, 0]] # [grid[r][c], r, c]
        visit.add((0, 0))

        directions = [[0, 1], [0, -1], [1, 0], [-1, 0]]

        while minHeap:
            t, r, c = heapq.heappop(minHeap)

            if r == N - 1 and c == N - 1:
                return t
            
            for dr, dc in directions:
                neiR, neiC = r + dr, c + dc

                if neiR < 0 or neiC < 0 or neiR >= N or neiC >= N or (neiR, neiC) in visit:
                    continue
                visit.add((neiR, neiC))
                heapq.heappush(minHeap, [max(t, grid[neiR][neiC]), neiR, neiC])
